Hello {% if user.first_name %} {{user.first_name}} {{user.last_name}} {% else %} {{user.username}} {% endif %},

During our automatic updates and checks, using the keyserver url that you provided, the system spotted that the key that is currently present on that URL will soon expire.

To avoid any issues, the key will be removed from Hawkpost when it expires and all open boxes deactivated until a new one is added. As such, please make sure to update your key as soon as possible.

Best regar
